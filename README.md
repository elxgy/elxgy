# Elxgy

Hi, I develop AIs and some CLI tools

-------------
# Projects:

## Centipede:

Local codebase analyzer, indexes your whole codebase locally and uses a bunch of search methods to retrive the most relevant information given your question/search and passes to local model(like the IBM granite, which is small and light) for it to help you understand the codebase faster.

## Gripen(WIP):

AI developed to talk like humans, with humans. Will have voice recognition, TTS, vision, and a personality independent of system prompts. Gripen will be able to join discord calls, watch my desktop on daily activities and more.

## Mirage:

CLI tool developed to help measure application performance and resource consumption. Helps you track how the application spends the computer resources in a lower level. 

## PokeCord:

A pokemon discord bot made using the pokeapi and discord integration with python. It has a bunch of funcionalities, capturing pokemon, inventory system with limited pokeballs, pokeballs with different catch chances and raid battles so you can join your friends to fight legendary pokemons and have a chance at capturing them.
