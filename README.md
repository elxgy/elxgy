# Elxgy

Hi, I develop AIs, some CLI tools and distributed systems

-------------
# Projects:

## [Centipede:](not public rn)

Local codebase analyzer, indexes your whole codebase locally and uses a bunch of search methods to retrive the most relevant information given your question/search and passes to local model(like the IBM granite, which is small and light) for it to help you understand the codebase faster.

## [PokeCord:](not public rn)

A pokemon discord bot made using the pokeapi and discord integration with python. It has a bunch of funcionalities, capturing pokemon, inventory system with limited pokeballs, pokeballs with different catch chances and raid battles so you can join your friends to fight legendary pokemons and have a chance at capturing them.

## [Chronos:](https://github.com/elxgy/chronos-frontend)

A synchronized youtube player to watch videos with friends. It syncs your video with the others in the room, using the host(person who created the room) as the reference point. Only host can control the video(skips, pauses, loop video, autoplay) but others can still add videos/playlists to the queue. It's optimized to not overload server with sync requests, taking into account for network jitter, sync error margins(0.5/1 sec) and internet drops.

## [Gripen(WIP):](https://github.com/elxgy/gripen-preview)

AI developed to talk like humans, with humans. Will have voice recognition, TTS, vision, and a personality independent of system prompts. Gripen will be able to join discord calls, watch my desktop on daily activities and more.
